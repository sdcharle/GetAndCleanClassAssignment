#Code Book For The 'Means of Means and Standard Deviations of the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones' Dataset 
 
##subject
Numeric code for experimental subject. There were 30 subjects, so the range of values is 1-30.
##activity
A character (factor) variable describing the activity the subject was engaged in when the measurements were taken. Possible values:

*LAYING
*SITTING
*STANDING
*WALKING
*WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
*WALKING_UPSTAIRS

Anybody who is a human being has either engaged in or witnessed these activities, so the labels need no further explanation.
